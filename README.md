# Coding Practice

Howdy! Welcome to my coding practice repository. This is where I will be contributing to self-studying Data Structures & Algorithms, programming fundamentals, and problem solving.

## Resources
The resources I am using throughout my journey are:
- Leetcode
- The Self-Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff
- The Self-Taught Computer Scientist by Cory Althoff
- Cracking the Coding Interview Gayle Laakmann McDowell

... and Python's respective documentation, of course.
